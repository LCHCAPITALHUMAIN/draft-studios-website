## Installing

Pretty typical for ReactJS projects, after cloning the repository, change-directory to it and run:

### `npm install`

Once that's done, run one of the options in [Available Scripts](#available-scripts), preferably `npm start`.

## Sending Feedback

Feel free to contact us using the Contact Form at the bottom of [http://draftstudios.com](http://draftstudios.com). We'd love to hear your thoughts, issues, and concerns. We usually respond within 48-hours. Reach out to us if you want our professional assistance as well. We do anything for money. Okay, bye!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## The ColdFusion Part

ColdFusion assets are located in /draft-studios-website/public/ and /draft-studios-website/public/services/. As long as you copy the build folder after running `npm run build` onto a ColdFusion Web Server reachable directory, everything should work fine.

## Why??

Why did we build it?? Basically, because it's fun and because we can. It started as a little project where we could showcase our talents online while keeping things light-hearted. We wanted it to resemble the side-scrolling video games we grew up playing, with throw-backs to The Simpsons and Mario. We don't exactly get to sit at home all day playing games after school anymore, so this is kind of our adult version of that. Mixing in a little nostalgia with a little bit of business.
