Why did we build it?? Basically, because it's fun and cuz we can. It started as a little project where we could showcase our talents online while keeping things fun. We wanted it to resemble the side scrolling video games we grew up playing. We dont exactly get to sit at home all day playing games after school anymore, so this was kind of our adult version of that. Mixing a little nostalgia with a little bit of business.
