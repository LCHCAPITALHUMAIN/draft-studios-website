      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Here lies the lab in which Minh and Jimmy of Draft Studios create funky stuff. Come back periodically, as we change things quite often. 
      The current iteration is the full kitchen sink demo that was presented at Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2018 at Hard Rock Hotel, Las Vegas!
      Details, code, and slides can be found at <a href="http://draftstudios.com/coldfusion-summit-2018">draftstudios.com/coldfusion-summit-2018</a>. 
      Unfortunately, you'll need to enable JavaScript to be able to run it.
